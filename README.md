### Update - The Dev Calc - Removed from Play Store

On **October 4, 2024**, The Dev Calc was removed from the Play Store due to non-compliance with Google Developer Program Policies.

No worries, though! It was a dream to have an app on the Play Store, even if it wasn't the best out there. A better version will be coming soon!
